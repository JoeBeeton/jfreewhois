JFreeWhois is a java based whois library compatible with android.

This was originally found on google code. But google have decided to cull google code so I've moved this project to github.
Hopefully soon I will get round to adding the newer TLD's to the server list.
Until then documentation is available here https://code.google.com/p/jfreewhois/ and http://www.freedonia.org.uk/blog/?p=124
